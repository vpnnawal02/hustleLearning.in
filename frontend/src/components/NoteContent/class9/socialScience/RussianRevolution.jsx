                                <p>Developments in the colonies also shaped and redefined these ideas of societal change, showing the two-way influence between Europe and its colonies.</p>

                                <p>One major group seeking to change society in the 19th century were the liberals, who wanted a nation that allowed religious tolerance for all.</p>

                                <p>At that time, most European states discriminated in favor of one religion: for example, Britain favored the Church of England, while Austria and Spain supported the Catholic Church.</p>

                                <p>Conservatives, on the other hand, strongly opposed both liberals and radicals. Before the French Revolution, they had resisted any form of change and defended the existing order.</p>

                                <p>However, by the 19th century, even conservatives admitted that some changes were necessary, though they insisted that change must be gradual, respectful of tradition, and carefully implemented.</p>

                                <p>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels added further ideas by arguing that industrial society was essentially capitalist, where capitalists owned factories and profits produced by workers were accumulated by owners, making improvement in workers' conditions impossible unless capitalism and private property were overthrown.</p>

                                <p>Marx believed that to end exploitation, workers had to construct a radically socialist society where all property was socially controlled, leading to a communist society, which he considered the natural society of the future, convinced that workers would ultimately triumph over capitalists.</p>

                                <p>In 1914, the First World War broke out between two European alliances: Germany, Austria, and Turkey (Central Powers) versus France, Britain, and Russia (later joined by Italy and Romania). Since each country had global empires, the war was fought both inside and outside Europe.</p>
                            </li>

                                <p>In Russia, the war was initially popular, and people rallied in support of Tsar Nicholas II, but as it dragged on, the Tsar's refusal to consult the Duma caused support to decline.</p>

                                <p>Anti-German sentiments rose, shown by the renaming of St Petersburg (a German name) to Petrograd. The Tsarina Alexandra's German origins and her reliance on the monk Rasputin further weakened public faith in the monarchy.</p>

                                <p>On the western front, the war was fought in trenches across eastern France, but on the eastern front, armies moved frequently, leading to large casualties.</p>

                                <p>Between 1914 and 1916, Russian armies faced heavy defeats in Germany and Austria, suffering over 7 million casualties by 1917.</p>

                                <p>As they retreated, the Russian army destroyed crops and buildings to prevent enemy use, which caused mass displacement and created over 3 million refugees within Russia. This worsened discontent, discredited the government, and lowered soldiers' morale, making them unwilling to fight.</p>

                                <p>The war severely affected Russian industry, as it already had limited industries and was cut off from foreign supplies due to German control of the Baltic Sea.</p>

                                <p>Industrial equipment in Russia wore out quickly; by 1916, railway lines began to collapse. With many able-bodied men drafted into the war, there were labour shortages, and many small workshops producing essentials shut down.</p>

                                <p>Large amounts of grain were diverted to the army, leading to food shortages in cities. By the winter of 1916, bread and flour scarcity led to riots at bread shops, showing the depth of urban crisis.</p>

                                <p>By the winter of 1917, conditions in Petrograd were extremely grim; the city's very layout highlighted divisions – the workers' quarters and factories were on the right bank of the River Neva, while the fashionable areas, the Winter Palace, official buildings, and the Duma were located on the left bank.</p>
                            </li>

                                <p>Severe food shortages were felt in the workers' quarters due to the exceptionally cold winter with heavy snow and frost, while tensions also rose because parliamentarians wanted to preserve the elected Duma, but the Tsar wanted to dissolve it.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="flex gap-2">

                                <p>On 22 February 1917, a lockout occurred at a factory on the right bank, and the next day, workers in about 50 factories went on strike in solidarity; women led many of these protests, and this day came to be marked as International Women's Day, with demonstrators crossing over to the city centre at Nevskii Prospekt.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="flex gap-2">

                                <p>At this stage, the movement was not politically organised by any party, but the scale of workers' protests forced the government to impose a curfew; however, workers returned in large numbers on 24 and 25 February, leading to the deployment of cavalry and police.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="flex gap-2">

                                <p>On 25 February (Sunday), the government suspended the Duma, which angered politicians and pushed demonstrators to return in greater force on 26 February; by 27 February, the situation escalated as the Police Headquarters were ransacked and huge crowds filled the streets, raising slogans for bread, better wages, shorter hours, and democracy.</p>
                            </li>

                                <p>The government attempted to control the situation using the cavalry again, but this time the cavalry refused to fire on the protestors; soon, mutiny spread as soldiers joined workers—an officer was shot at one regiment's barracks, and three other regiments mutinied, deciding to support the striking workers.</p>
                            </li>

                                <p>By the evening of 27 February, both soldiers and striking workers united to form a soviet (council) in the same building where the Duma met; this became known as the Petrograd Soviet.</p>

                                <p>On 2 March 1917, a delegation of Soviet and Duma leaders met the Tsar, and under the advice of military commanders, Tsar Nicholas II abdicated the throne; this marked the end of monarchy in Russia.</p>
                            </li>

                                <p>Following the abdication, Soviet leaders and Duma leaders came together to form a Provisional Government to run the country until a Constituent Assembly, elected on the basis of universal adult suffrage, could decide Russia's future.</p>

                                <p>Thus, Petrograd became the epicentre of the February Revolution of 1917, which successfully brought down the centuries-old autocratic Tsarist monarchy.</p>

                                <p>The Provisional Government was strongly influenced by army officials, landowners, and industrialists, though liberals and socialists within it worked towards establishing an elected government, and restrictions on public meetings and associations were removed, allowing soviets like the Petrograd Soviet to be set up across Russia, even though there was no uniform system of election for them.</p>

                                <p>In April 1917, Vladimir Lenin, leader of the Bolsheviks, returned from exile and presented his famous April Theses, demanding an immediate end to the war, transfer of land to peasants, and nationalisation of banks; he also urged that the Bolshevik Party rename itself the Communist Party to reflect its radical aims.</p>

                                <p>Initially, many Bolsheviks were skeptical of Lenin's demands, believing that Russia was not yet ready for a socialist revolution and that the Provisional Government should be supported, but the unfolding events of the following months gradually shifted their attitude towards Lenin's position.</p>

                                <p>During the summer of 1917, the workers' movement intensified—factory committees were formed that challenged the authority of industrialists, trade unions grew rapidly, and within the army, soldiers' committees were created, showing growing discontent and organisation among both workers and soldiers.</p>

                                <p>In June 1917, about 500 soviets sent representatives to an All-Russian Congress of Soviets, which strengthened Bolshevik influence; alarmed by this, the Provisional Government cracked down, resisting workers' attempts to run factories and arresting Bolshevik leaders, while popular demonstrations in July staged by Bolsheviks were harshly suppressed, forcing many leaders to go into hiding or exile.</p>

                                <p>The uprising began on 24 October 1917: Prime Minister Kerenskii left Petrograd to summon reinforcements, while pro-government forces seized Bolshevik newspapers, telegraph, and telephone offices, and guarded the Winter Palace.</p>

                                <p>In response, the Military Revolutionary Committee quickly ordered its supporters to take control of government offices and arrest ministers; later, the battleship Aurora fired at the Winter Palace, and other vessels secured key military positions in the city.</p>

                                <p>To solve shortages, Stalin introduced the policy of collectivisation (from 1929), arguing that small peasant farms could not be modernised and that large, mechanised, state-controlled farms were needed.</p>

                                <p>Under collectivisation, peasants were forced to join collective farms (kolkhoz) where land and implements were pooled, and profits shared.</p>

                                <p>Peasants resisted collectivisation by destroying livestock and refusing to cooperate; as a result, between 1929–31, the number of cattle declined by one-third.</p>

                                <p>Those who resisted were punished, deported, or exiled. Though peasants insisted they were not against socialism, they did not want to work on collective farms.</p>

                                <p>Despite collectivisation, agricultural production did not rise immediately; instead, the bad harvests of 1930–33 caused a devastating famine, killing over 4 million people.</p>

                                <p>Many Party members criticised industrial confusion and collectivisation's failures, but Stalin crushed dissent, accusing critics of being anti-socialist.</p>

                                <p>By 1939, over 2 million people were in prisons or labour camps; many were innocent but forced to make false confessions under torture, and several were executed, including skilled professionals.</p>
